# Lab 7

For this lab, you will create an XML file that conforms to the structure defined in an XML Schema and contains data as described below.

`restaurant-schema.xsd` defines the structure of xml data that could be used by a restaurant.

`xml_validator` is a simple python script that will parse and validate an xml file. It requires the `lxml` pip package to be installed (`pip install lxml`), and then it can be run on the command line:

``` 
python xml_validator.py restaurant-data.xml
```

By default, it will look for `restaurant-schema.xsd` to use as the schema, but you can optionally define another schema as another command line argument. 

## Assignment

You need to construct an xml file: `restaurant-data.xml` that's structured according to the schema. It needs to include data that describes the following:

- The restaurant name should be "Data Bites Restaurant"
- The menu should contain at least two recipes
- The menu should contain a recipe named "Chili", which would be in the "Fall" season.
- There should be exactly three employees
- There should be exactly one employee whose job is "dishwasher" and they should be paid "10.00".
- Some recipe should contain exactly 6 ingredients

As with other labs, you may work in groups of up to 3 students.

## Submission

You should submit your `restaurant-data.xml` file to submitty.

This lab is due by 11:59pm on Friday April 17. You may use up to 3 late days.

## Grading

You will receive 8 points if your submitted file is properly formatted and valid xml (according to the provided schema).

You will receive 2 points for each of the above data elements that your data file describes.

**Total 20 points**
